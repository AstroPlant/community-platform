## Data Structure

A complete schema of the data structure of the API can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G225oLnQ1Is-vijgxq9hwHoDR8GipKjx/view?usp=sharing).

## Connection to AstroPlant API

This API is using to the [official AstroPlant Data API](https://github.com/AstroPlant/astroplant-api) to access kits data and users. Users currently have to use the same credentials in order to be able to successfully access their kits data on the community platform.

> :warning: This behaviour is only temporary and we are planning to install a common authentication system for the different platform.

# Roadmap

[x] Build structure for static content sharing & publication (articles, libraries, users etc.)
[] Structure for graph creation & edition on kit dashboard.
[] Password reset & change. This is currently dependent of [AstroPlant Data API](https://github.com/AstroPlant/astroplant-api) and those features aren't available yet.
[] Email verification & notification when signing up.
